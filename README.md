# balenaBlocks

balenaBlocks are a type of "app enablement". They are docker images which you can drop into your project to provide some functionality you need. For example, if you have a webApp and you wish to display it on a connected display, you can add the [browser block](https://github.com/balenablocks/browser) to your docker compose and hey presto!

You can find a more detailed explaination of blocks here: https://www.balena.io/blog/introducing-balenablocks-jumpstart-your-iot-app-development/
